abstract = "In recent years, the growth of low-power and high-performance systems has led to an increase in interest in approximate computing. Approximate computing reduces the power consumption of a typical system with a penalty of output quality reduction. Using approximation in computer aided design applications needs a simple yet accurate method to estimate systems quality. An analytical method to measure the quality of approximate computing circuits is proposed. The previous works on the quality estimation of approximate systems are mostly based on simulation and thus error estimation is too time-consuming for a feasible solution. Moreover, an analytical algorithm to estimate system quality that is not based on operator type and approximation method is proposed. Error calculation of feedback systems is also a key feature of this method that did not discuss in previous works. In addition, an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for approximate computing systems synthesis using the proposed estimation method is introduced. Experimental results showed that the proposed method reduced quality checking time considerably with an estimation accuracy above 90 percent."
