# Biography

Hi, I'm Reza, a MSc student of computer architecture at the [University of Tehran](http://ut.ac.ir/en) currently living in the city of Tehran, Iran. I am a member of High Performance Embedded and Architecture Lab (HiPEAL), under supervision of [Dr. Saeed Safari](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~saeed). We are mainly researching on approximate computing, general purpose GPUs, hardware implementation of conventional and spiking neural networks.

My major research interest is design of accelerators, proposing new architecture or fine tune existing ones for different workloads, and high-level synthesis. I am currently working on the power efficiency on batch and stream workloads. My skill sets span over both hardware design techniques (using HDLs) and software programming (C/C++, Python). Right now, I am looking for a position to continue my education in PhD. Here is my {{% staticref "files/Reza_CV.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}.
